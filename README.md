Requires installs for this 
pip install -U discord.py
pip install -U python-dotenv

You will need to create a .env file in the same directory as the source code. This file will be how you manage your access token, your guild (server) name, your channel, and the role requires to use the clear all feature. These 4 things must be labeled like so:
DISCORD_TOKEN=token
DISCORD_GUILD=guild
DISCORD_CHANNEL=channel
ADMIN_ROLE=admin role

Replace token, guild, channel, and admin role with their respective values.
